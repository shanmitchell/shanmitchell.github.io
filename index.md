# Shannon Mitchell — Technical Writing Portfolio

Senior Technical Writer with 10+ years of experience shaping product documentation and Help Center experiences for SaaS and AI-driven platforms. I focus on helping users succeed quickly with powerful, evolving products by turning complex systems into clear, confidence-building guidance.

I work closely with Product, Engineering, and CX to ensure documentation is accurate, discoverable, and ready at launch—supporting everyone from first-time builders to advanced users working at speed.

## What I bring to product teams
- Documentation that supports learning, iteration, and successful outcomes
- Help Center strategy, information architecture, and content audits
- Modular, structured content designed to scale with fast-moving products
- Feature documentation and release notes aligned to real product behavior
- User-focused guidance that reduces support friction and builds trust
