# Shannon Mitchell — Technical Writing Portfolio

Senior Technical Writer with 10+ years of experience shaping product documentation and Help Center experiences for SaaS and AI-driven platforms. I specialize in helping users succeed quickly with complex products by translating evolving systems into clear, approachable, and confidence-building documentation.

I work closely with Product, Engineering, and CX to ensure documentation is accurate, discoverable, and ready at launch—supporting everyone from first-time builders to advanced users.

## What I focus on
- Help Center strategy, information architecture, and content audits
- Modular, structured documentation that scales with fast-moving products
- Feature documentation and release notes aligned to product launches
- User-focused guidance that supports self-service and reduces support friction
