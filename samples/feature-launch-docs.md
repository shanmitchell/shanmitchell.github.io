# Feature Launch Documentation & Release Notes (AI Product)

## What it is
A reconstructed (non-proprietary) example showing how I document a new feature for an AI-driven product, including Help Center updates and release notes aligned to a product launch.

This sample focuses on clarity, launch readiness, and user confidence during rapid product iteration.

## Scenario
An AI application builder introduces a new capability that allows users to:
- refine generated output through iterative prompts
- preview changes before applying them
- revert safely if results aren’t as expected

The feature is released quickly and needs clear documentation at launch.

## Documentation approach

### 1) Understand the user impact
Before writing, I align with Product and Engineering to answer:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who benefits immediately?
- What existing workflows change?
- What could confuse or break user expectations?

This informs both Help Center content and release notes.

### 2) Help Center article structure
**Title:** Iterating on generated output

**Summary:**  
Learn how to refine AI-generated output using small, controlled changes while preserving existing work.

**When to use this**
- You want to adjust behavior without rebuilding from scratch
- You’re experimenting and want predictable results
- You need a safe way to undo changes

**How it works**
1. Review the current output
2. Describe the desired change in one sentence
3. Specify what should stay the same
4. Preview the result
5. Apply or revert

**Tips**
- Make one change at a time
- Avoid combining unrelated requests
- Use examples when possible

- Troubleshooting unexpected output

### 3) Release notes (customer-facing)

**New: Safer iteration for generated output**

You can now refine AI-generated output in smaller, more controlled steps. Preview changes before applying them, and revert easily if the result isn’t what you expected.

This update makes experimentation faster and more predictable—especially when exploring new ideas.

---

### 4) Internal readiness
Alongside customer-facing docs, I typically ensure:
- Support teams have a short internal summary
- Known limitations are documented
- Links to new Help Center articles are included in release communications

This reduces confusion at launch and improves first-response quality.

---

## Outcome
This documentation approach:
- supports confident experimentation
- reduces support tickets after release
- keeps documentation aligned with real product behavior
- scales as features evolve

It also ensures documentation is part of the launch—not an afterthought.
